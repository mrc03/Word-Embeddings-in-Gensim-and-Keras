# Word-Embeddings-in-Gensim-and-Keras

A simple implementation of word embeddings in Gensim and Keras libraries. 

I have implemented famous Word2Vec in Gensim library. Then I have also used t-SNE to reduce the dimensions and then visualized the same using a scatter plot in plotly library.

As an alternative I have also used Keras embedding layer to generate the word embeddings.
